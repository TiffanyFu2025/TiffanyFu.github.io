A passionate high school dancer, I’ve brought my love for movement to the stage in many competitions and performances. Beyond the spotlight, I’ve taken part in academic research, social initiatives, and volunteer efforts that have shaped who I am. I believe in balancing artistic expression with intellectual curiosity and community spirit.
